# Welcome to my Jupyter Book &#8212; KNN Classifier and Regressor

Welcome to my project for the "Data and Web Mining" course conducted during the academic year 2023/2024.

My project involves a comprehensive analysis of the KNN algorithm, studied during this course. It is based on both practical and theoretical aspects, delving into every single detail of the algorithm itself, with the assistance of the sklearn library.

Let's start with the [theoretical part](theory.ipynb), where, as explained earlier, I focused on examining all the theoretical aspects of the algorithm. We continue our journey with the[ analysis and management of the example dataset](data_process.ipynb), where you can find a more in-depth analysis and an explanation of each choice I made.

Then, we move on to the [practical execution of the algorithm](knn.ipynb), trying everything necessary to achieve the most optimized model possible.

Finally, there's a [summary of all the analyses](main_branch.ipynb) conducted so far, where I draw conclusions based on the earlier examinations.
